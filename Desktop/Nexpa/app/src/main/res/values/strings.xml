        Nexpa App Privacy Policy\n\n
         Our Services instantly connect people within a specified range by way of public announcements/broadcasts. Any registered user of the Nexpa Services can send a broadcast, which is a message of 150 characters or less that is public by default and can include other content like photos, videos, and links to other websites.\n\n
        Tip: What you say on the Nexpa Services may be viewed in your defined range of up to 50km or World Wide instantly.\n\n
        This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how and when Nexpa collects, uses and shares your information when you use our Services. Nexpa receives your information through our applications, SMS, APIs, email notifications, buttons, widgets and ads. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n
         You alone control and are responsible for the posting of your broadcasts and other content you submit through the Services, as provided in the Terms of Service  and Nexpa Rules.\n\n
        Irrespective of which country you live in, you authorize us to use your information in, and as a result to transfer it to and store it in any country where we operate. Privacy and data protection laws in some of these countries may vary from the laws in the country where you live.\n\n
         If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at www.nexpaapp.com.\n\n
        Information Collection and Use\n\n
        Tip: We collect and use your information below to provide our Services and to measure and improve them over time.\n\n
        Basic Account Information: When you create or reconfigure an account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password and email address. On the Nexpa Services, your name and username are listed publicly, including on your profile page and in search results, and you can use either your real name or a pseudonym.\n\n
         Contact Information: You may use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to customize your account or enable Services. If you provide Nexpa with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages to that number from Nexpa. When you use Nexpa to sign up for or login to a third-party application, you are directing Nexpa to share your contact information, such as your phone number, with that application. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, to market to you, to help prevent spam, fraud, or abuse, and to help others find your account, including through third-party services and client applications. You may use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from the Nexpa Services. You may also unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or the instructions on our website. Your privacy settings control whether others can find you on the Nexpa Services by your email address or phone number.\n\n
         Additional Information: You may provide us with profile information to make public on the Nexpa Services, such as a short biography, your location, your website, date of birth, or a picture. If you provide us with profile information and you don’t see a visibility setting, that information is public. You may choose to upload and sync your address book so that we can help you find and connect with users you know or help other users find and connect with you. We may later tailor content, such as making suggestions or showing user accounts and Broadcasts for you and other users based on imported address book contacts. You can delete your imported address book contacts at any time. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your account on our Services to your account on another service in order to cross-post between our Services and that service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. This information enables cross-posting, helps us improve the Services, and is deleted from our Services within a few weeks of your disconnecting from our Services your account on the other service. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.\n
         Broadcasts, Profiles and other Public Information: Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide us through the Nexpa Services is information you are asking us to make public. Your public information includes the messages you broadcast; the metadata provided with broadcasts, such as when you braodcastes and the client application you used to Broadcast; the language and time zone associated with your account; and the lists you create, people you follow, Broadcasts you mark as likes or Rebroadcast, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Nexpa Services. We may use this information to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content we show you, including ads. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide through the Nexpa Services public for as long as you do not delete it, but we generally give you access to direct messages, to make the information more private if you want. The Nexpa Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile information and public Broadcasts are immediately delivered via SMS and our APIs to our partners and other third parties, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate Nexpa content into their services, and institutions such as universities and public health agencies that analyze the information for trends and insights. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.\n\n
         Location Information: Nexpa may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to publish your location in your Broadcasts and in your Nexpa profile. You may also tell us your location when you set your trend location on Nexpa.com. We may also determine location by using other data from your device, such as precise location information from GPS, information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as Broadcasting with your location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow.\n\n
         Links: Nexpa may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.\n\n 
         Cookies: Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer or mobile device. Nexpa may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, some browsers’ settings can be modified to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies. We honor the Do Not Track browser option to give you control over how your website visits are used to personalize your Nexpa experience and ads.\n\n 
         Log Data: When you use our Services, we may receive information (“Log Data”) such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party website or application, or visit a third-party service that includes a Nexpa button or widget. We may also receive Log Data when you click on, view or interact with links on our Services, including links to third-party applications, such as when you choose to install another application through Nexpa. Nexpa uses Log Data to provide, understand, and improve our Services, to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content we show you, including ads. If not already done earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after a maximum of 18 months.\n\n
         Widget Data: We may tailor the Services for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate Nexpa buttons or widgets. When these websites first load our buttons or widgets for display, we receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited and a cookie that identifies your browser (“Widget Data”). After a maximum of 10 days, we start the process of deleting, de-identifying, or aggregating Widget Data, which is usually instantaneous but in some cases may take up to a week. We may use Widget Data to tailor content for you, such as suggestions for people to follow and other content you may be interested in. Tailored content is stored with only browser cookies or device IDs and is separated from other Widget Data such as page-visit information. For Broadcasts, Log Data, and other information that we receive from interactions with Nexpa buttons or widgets, please see the other sections of this Privacy Policy.\n\n
         Third-Parties and Affiliates: Nexpa uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your device as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser cookie ID, website URL visited, mobile device ID, or cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure and tailor ads.\n\n
        Information Sharing and Disclosure\n\n
        Tip: We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described here.\n\n
        User Consent or Direction: We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account. Other users may share or disclose information about you, such as when they mention you, share a photo of you, or tag you in a photo. Your privacy settings control who can tag you in a photo on the Nexpa Services. If you’ve shared information, like direct messages or protected Broadcasts, with another user who accesses the Nexpa Services through a third-party service, keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.\n\n
         Service Providers: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States, Australia, Philippines, and other countries. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. We share your Payment Information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit or debit cards.\n\n 
         Law and Harm: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process or government request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Nexpa’s rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.\n\n
         Business Transfers and Affiliates: In the event that Nexpa is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.\n\n
         Non-Private or Non-Personal Information: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile information, public Broadcasts, the people you follow or that follow you, or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did), or reports to advertisers about unique users who saw or clicked on their ads after we have removed any private personal information (such as your name or contact information).\n\n
        Accessing and Modifying Your Personal Information\n\n
        If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access, correct, delete, or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.
         You can also permanently delete your Nexpa account. When your account is deactivated, it is not viewable on Nexpa.com. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. Absent a separate arrangement between you and Nexpa to extend your deactivation period, after 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your account from our systems, which can take up to a week.
         Keep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still retain copies of your public information, like your user profile information and public Broadcasts, even after you have deleted the information from the Nexpa Services or deactivated your account.\n\n
        Our Policy Towards Children\n\n
        Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child’s account.\n\n
        Changes to this Policy\n\n
        We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at NEXPA LINK. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an @NEXPA update or email to the email address associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.\n\n
         Effective: August 1, 2016 Thoughts or questions about this Privacy Policy? Please email us.

        4. Content on the Services\n\n

        7. Nexpa Rights\n\n
        All right, title, and interest in and to the Services (excluding Content provided by users) are and will remain the exclusive property of Nexpa and its licensors. Nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use the Nexpa name or any of the Nexpa trademarks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.

        9. Copyright Policy\n\n
        Nexpa respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects users of the Services to do the same. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us. If you believe that your Content has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: (i) a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf; (ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed; (iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (iv) your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address; (v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.\n
         We reserve the right to remove Content alleged to be infringing without prior notice, at our sole discretion, and without liability to you. In appropriate circumstances, Nexpa will also terminate a user’s account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.\n\n
        10. Ending These Terms\n\n
        The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Nexpa as follows.\n
         You may end your legal agreement with Nexpa at any time for any or no reason by deactivating your accounts and discontinuing your use of the Services. You do not need to specifically inform Nexpa when you stop using the Services. If you stop using the Services without deactivating your accounts, your accounts may be deactivated due to prolonged inactivity under our Inactive Account Policy.\n
         We may suspend or terminate your accounts or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any or no reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or the Nexpa Rules, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (iii) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your account or the next time you attempt to access your account.\n
         In all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12.\n
         Nothing in this section shall affect Nexpa’s rights to change, limit or stop the provision of the Services without prior notice, as provided above in section 1.\n\n
        11.Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability\n\n
        Please read this section carefully since it limits the liability of Nexpa and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors (collectively, the “Nexpa Entities”). Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.\n
        A. The Services are Available “AS-IS”\n
        Your access to and use of the Services or any Content are at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Services are provided to you on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, THE NEXPA ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n
         The Nexpa Entities make no warranty or representation and disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (i) the completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the Services or any Content; (ii) any harm to your computer system, loss of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services or any Content; (iii) the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any Content and other communications maintained by the Services; and (iv) whether the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the Nexpa Entities or through the Services, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein.\n\n
        B. Links\n\n
        The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that the Nexpa Entities are not responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such websites or resources; or (ii) the content, products, or services on or available from such websites or resources. Links to such websites or resources do not imply any endorsement by the Nexpa Entities of such websites or resources or the content, products, or services available from such websites or resources. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources.\n\n
        C. Limitation of Liability\n\n
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE NEXPA ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.\n
         IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE NEXPA ENTITIES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID NEXPA, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.\n
         THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE NEXPA ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\n\n
        12. General Terms\n\n
        A. Waiver and Severability\n\n
        The failure of Nexpa to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.\n\n
        B. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction\n\n
        These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of New South Wales, Australia without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence. All claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection with the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in the City of Sydney, NSW, Australia, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.\n
         If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in Australia using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of California (excluding choice of law).\n\n
        C. Entire Agreement\n\n
        These Terms, including the Nexpa Rules for the Nexpa Services, and our Privacy Policy are the entire and exclusive agreement between Nexpa and you regarding the Services (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement with Nexpa that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Nexpa and you regarding the Services. Other than members of the group of companies of which Nexpa, Inc. is the parent, no other person or company will be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.\n
         We may revise these Terms from time to time, the most current version will always be at Nexpa.com. If the revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you via an @Nexpa update or e-mail to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.\n\n
         Effective: January 27th, 2016\n
